Be patient and allow them time to build trust. Spend time with them every day to let them get used to you. Start by talking to them and then feeding them.</p>

    <p>The guinea pig was first domesticated as long ago as 2000BC in the Andes in South America, in the region now known as Peru and Bolivia. They were originally kept for food, but some may have become family pets for the children at that time. Guinea pigs were not often bought; rather they were given as presents, especially as wedding gifts, or as gifts to special guests or children! They would be kept in the household kitchen, where they would be allowed to run around freely. </p>
    <p>Originally coming from the Andes in South America, these gentle animals love spending time with their owners, exploring, and being groomed. It's recommended to adopt two or more guinea pigs at the same time because of their social nature. It's also important to find the right bedding and make sure they're getting enough vitamin C.</p>

    <h2>Learn Your Guinea Pig's Noises</h2>
    <img src="img/back_guinea_pig.jpg" alt="black guinea pig with flower" class="black-guinea"> 
    <p>Guinea pigs are naturally social creatures, and exhibit a wide range of behavioral expressions. If you can learn to interpret these behaviors, it will make for a much better relationship with your pet. Here’s a guide for some of the behavioral patterns your guinea pig may exhibit:</p>
    <p><strong>Weeking: </strong>High-pitched wheeking means your pet is excited and/or very happy. Guinea pigs may wheek in anticipation of something, such as a treat, dinner or snack time, or even attention. Weeking (or a fun word I like to use is yelling happily) is a good sign. Unless when you touch them in a certain area and they start shrieking and that means that they may be in pain. So if you hear this please take them to a doctor.</p>
    <p><strong>Purring: </strong>Cats aren't the only pets that purr. While a guinea pig's purring sound is a deeper and more consistent sound, the meaning is the same: a purring guinea pig is comfortable. You want your guinea pig to purr.</p>
    <p><strong>Chuting: </strong>A chut is also a positive sound. Guinea pigs only create this series of short, staccato noises when they are cheerfully exploring their surrounding</p>
    <p><strong>Rumbling: </strong>This sound is very alike to the purring but the best way to tell them apart is by looking at the behaviors that go along with them, as the male (boar) guinea pigs rumble during the courting of females (sows). It is a slightly lower sound than a purr and sometimes there's a mating dance that goes along with it.</p>
    <p><strong>Whining: </strong>A whining or a moaning type of squeak can communicate annoyance or dislike for something you or another guinea pig is doing. It sounds like what it says</p>

    <h2>FOOD! What are safe and unsafe foods for my guinea pig?</h2>
    <img src="img/kitchen-guinea.jpg" alt="american guinea pig cooking at a stove" class="kitchen-guinea"> 
    <p>It’s important that every guinea pig that you raise have its own bowl of vegetables each day. You need to make sure that you offer a variety, though. This is your only way of ensuring that your guinea pigs have all their nutritional needs met. Plying your poor guinea pigs with the same food each day may keep them alive, but they won’t be healthy or happy.</p>
    <p>Fresh fruits and veggies are great treats and supplements for your guinea pig. Vegetables and fruits are great treats to offer your guinea pig. You can use these as extra-special offerings to help bond with your guinea pig or as treats for training.</p>
    <h3><strong>Here are 5 foods that you should feed your guinea pig:</strong></h3>
    <ul class="best-food">
      <li><strong>Hay: </strong>Guinea pigs are more like cows than other rodents – they are grazers. They need access to plenty of hay to chew on and to nest in. Their digestive systems are designed to process fibrous hay and cannot function adequately without a good supply. Whatever other food you give your guinea pigs, it’s the hay that gets the rest of their food through their digestive systems. Unless you have a baby guinea pig or a pregnant one, you should make sure that you don’t bring in alfalfa hay. The high levels of calcium found in this type of hay harms adult guinea pigs that aren’t pregnant or nursing. It’s easy to find hay pellets made of the right kind of hay at any pet store.</li>
      <li><strong>Tomato: </strong>Guinea pigs love all kinds of tomato – cherry, Roma, grape etc. They are great for vitamin C. You should make sure that your guinea pigs don’t get more than the equivalent of a quarter of a regular tomato each day, though.</li>
      <li><strong>Parsley: </strong>While guinea pigs love crunchy parsley, you should make sure that they get no more than an inch-long segment each day.</li>
      <li><strong>Romaine lettuce: </strong>Guinea pigs can only handle a small quantity each day. They can get kidney stones with any more than a fragment each day.</li>
      <li><strong>Peppers: </strong>Bell peppers are rich in vitamin C and guinea pigs relish them. It’s a good idea to bring in as much variety as possible. Buy them in every color that you find – orange, yellow, red and green, but make sure you buy organic foods.</li>
    </ul> 
    <h3><strong>Here are 5 foods that are toxic to your guinea pig:</strong></h3>
    <ul class="best-food">
      <li>Animal Products</li>
      <li>Chocolate</li>
      <li>Popcorn</li>
      <li>Potatoes</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>The guinea pig’s system is nothing like what humans have. Just because you enjoy a food, doesn’t mean that your guinea pig will relish them. Even if it does like them, some foods that are perfectly harmless to humans can be toxic to guinea pigs. Be sure to consult your vet before feeding your guinea pig any new food.</p>

    <h2>How and when do guinea pigs sleep?</h2>
    <img src="img/sleeping-guinea.jpg" alt="sleeping guinea pig" class="sleeping-guinea"> 
    <p>Lot of people have wondered how guinea pigs sleep and when? Well to begin we want to make sure that our guinea pig is getting the best nap time.</p>
    <p>So first, all guinea pigs sleep differently but what happens in their brain is the same. What they experience is all sensory systems reviewed (visual, auditory, vestibular, somesthetic and olfactory) demonstrate some influence on sleep and at the same time the sensory systems undergo changes that depend on the sleep and/or waking state of the brain. So half of the brain is awake and half is asleep. Why they have this brain activity is because in the wild they would need half of their brain to be aware if predators are lurking around. Now to talk about when they sleep, they have short naps during the day and night. They are mostly awake during dawn and dusk. On average, guinea pigs sleep around 4 hours every day, which they do in small laps. Unlike other animals, they usually sleep in short laps of 10-30 minutes. In the night time, they typically nap for a more extended period than during the day.</p>
    <p>In case anything is off with your guinea pig sleep time please consult a doctor.</p>
